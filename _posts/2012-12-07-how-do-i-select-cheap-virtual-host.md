recently, I am using virtual host for SEO, but choosing virtual host is really a boring thing, I have tried many venders, but until now I cannot find a satisfied one.

Since i am living China, the shit government makes lots obstracle in the internet, so, I have to use VPN or proxy to access some foreign websit, what&#8217;more, the foreign company does not trust Chinese people&#8217;s credit, they often need to strictly validate our information &#8230;. all of this make my virtual host setup becomes trouble and frustrated.

I first select a virtual host in Taobao, which is the biggest C2C e-business website, I found a store running by a Chinese guy, their name is &#8220;LaoXueZhuJi( laoxuehost.com)&#8221;, it is really cheap, 5Yuan/mo,  so, I bought 2 virtual host, after trying sometime, I found they are very slow unless you use VPN, and more bad thing is, they often down, the answer from their helpdesk, is , the physical server is attacted by DDOS,  God!

I have to turn to other famous vender, some friend suggest me &#8220;hostgator.com&#8221;, it is not so expensive, so, i think, why not try? I applied for 1 month trial, spend 8$, but, nightmare came, then. My account is blocked after I used for 1 day. I talked to their online helpdesk, they ask me to verify my account, they said maybe i miss some information or wrong information. but you know, calling USA is quite expensive cost for Chinese, I tried to use skype, but failed(it&#8217;s another story, skype is trash, at least for me), so, I asked them to call me, then I get a call from hostgator. The girl asked me the account name, but I cannot give her the satisfied answer, because i do forget the exact information I input 2 days before, she insist that she cannot verify me. I was angry! I told her I cannot provide other information, and if she cannot help me to verify, i will use hostgator never. Fortunately, at last, she passed my verification.

Then, I tried bluehost, which is the most famous host. I have to say, it really deserves it, the register and purchasing process is very smooth, and at last, I bought whole year service. Without networkband, disk, and domain parking limitation, yeah! I am satisfied with it.

Still, I investigated some other vender, but not try, just compared their products and packages, most are not impressive, except ixwebhosting, their package can provide 15 dedicated IPs for us,cool, but I missed their promotion duration, so, i wanna to wait Christmas for their promotion coupon.

That&#8217;s my virtual host selection experience, hope can help you!
